# Memory Game Project
### Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program
The player wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
This project utilizes JavaScript to achieve the following functionality:

- Cards are randomly shuffled each time a new game is started.
- When a user wins the game, a congratulatory modal appears and prompts the user to play again. It also tells the user how many seconds it took to win the game, what their star rating is, and how many moves they made.
- A 'new game' button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, the move counter, and the star rating.
- The game displays a three-star rating that decreases as the number of moves the player makes goes up.
- A timer is activated on the first card click and the elapsed game play time is displayed on screen. The timer stops when the player wins the game.
